#  Virtual Tourist

I built this app as part of the iOS Nanodegree at Udacity.

The app allows users to drop pins on a map with a long press, and then clicking on the pin
will load photos from the Flickr API for that location, as if the user is a virtual tourist for that
location.

## API Key Needed

In order for the app to run appropriately, an API key for Flickr must be added in `APIClient.swift`,
on line 14, for the `apiKey` variable. You can obtain an API key [here](https://www.flickr.com/services/apps/create/).
